Set up the game board: Create a graphical representation of the Ludo board using a library like Pygame or Tkinter. Divide the board into colored sections for each player and mark the starting positions, home areas, and safe zones.

Define game rules: Establish the rules of Ludo, such as the number of players, their turn order, and the movement rules for the game pieces. This includes rolling the dice, moving the tokens, capturing opponents' tokens, and entering the home area.

Implement game logic: Write code to handle the game logic, including dice rolling, token movement, capturing opponents' tokens, and checking for winning conditions. Maintain the state of the game, track player turns, and update the board accordingly.

Handle player input: Allow players to interact with the game by rolling the dice and selecting tokens to move. Implement event handling to capture player actions and update the game state accordingly.

Display game information: Show relevant information during the game, such as the current player's turn, dice values, and captured tokens. Update the graphical representation of the board to reflect the current state.

Check for winning conditions: Continuously check for winning conditions, such as a player successfully moving all their tokens into the home area. Declare the winner and end the game when the conditions are met.

Play again or exit: Provide an option to play again or exit the game after a game ends. Handle player input for restarting the game or exiting the program.
